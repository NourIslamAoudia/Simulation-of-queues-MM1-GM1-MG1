# Queue Simulation: M/M/1, G/M/1 and M/G/1

This project is a Python implementation of single-server queue simulations to compare the behavior of three different models: M/M/1, G/M/1, and M/G/1.

## Description

This simulation allows analyzing and comparing the performance of different queueing systems based on the arrival rate λ. The main metrics studied are:

- Average response time (time spent in the system)
- Server utilization rate (ρ = λ/μ)
- Average waiting time in the queue

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

You can install them with pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage

Execute the main script:
```bash
python simulation.py
```
